# 🚀 Transmission Liquid Glass Icon

A Liquid Glass icon designed for [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com) to fit macOS 26's Liquid Glass aesthetic. Simple and consistent with the new Tahoe style. No unflattering gray squircle and no Big Sur-era 3D shading.

🎨 Color reference and general visual direction take inspiration from the [Transmission icon used in Linux Mint's Mint-Y theme](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-y-icons/blob/96559032abbe87325d25a37df69202d5d1005e40/src/apps/transmission.svg).

## 📁 Assets

- **`.icon` File (macOS 26+)** - Native Liquid Glass icon with automatic light/dark switching. Intended for maintainers or anyone building Transmission from source. Crucially, this cannot be applied through Finder’s Get Info menu.
  
* **Raw PNGs** - Original 1024x1024 renders without padding or shadow. Not ideal for direct replacement (appears oversized).

* **Padded PNGs** - Scaled down to fit and match other apps in the Dock and app switcher. Does not have a shadow like other app icons.

* **Padded Shadow PNGs** - Sized and shadowed to visually match modern macOS icons. Recommended for most users replacing the app icon ✅
